# Quantum Classification

This is a Quantum machine learning simulator using Pennylane.

`classical_and_quantum_classifier.ipynb` compares quantum classification with the classical one using a test dataset (OR dataset). `quantum_classifier.ipynb` sees the trainability of quantum classification using more practical datasets.

`circuit_structure_effect_on_trainability.ipynb` checks the effect of circuit structures and cost functions on the trainability of QML.

# Quantum Classification

This repository contains the code for Quantum machine learning using Pennylane.

We compare quantum classification with classical classification using a test dataset (OR dataset) in `tests/classical_and_quantum_classifier.ipynb`, and also check the trainability of quantum classification for more practical datasets in `notebooks/quantum_classifier.ipynb`.

We see the effect of quantum circuit structures on the trainability of QML in `notebooks/circuit_structure_effect_on_trainability.ipynb`.

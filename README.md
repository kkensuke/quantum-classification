# Quantum Classification

We compare quantum classification with classical one in `classical_and_quantum_classifier.ipynb` using test dataset (OR dataset), and see the trainability of quantum classification using more practical datasets in `quantum_classifier.ipynb`.

We check the effect of circuit structures and cost functions on the trainability of QML in `circuit_structure_effect_on_trainability.ipynb`.
